TODO: Picture of Celty (the server)


So why did I go with this setup ? I wanted to be able to transcode 4k so I don't have to keep 2 versions of every movies, and I wanted this upgrade to be my engame for a long time and at the same time, to still be upgradable if I need to, hence the single stick of ram and the Z490 chipset (that will be compatible with 11th gen intel core and their Xe iGPUs). This motherboard also has 2.5Gb ethernet which may be important for the future.
## Hardware

It's a [i3-10100](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/199283/intel-core-i310100-processor-6m-cache-up-to-4-30-ghz.html) with 16Gb of DDR4 and a lot of storage. The os is installed on a ZFS mirrored NVME drive for reliability.

One of the issue I faced is my motherboard disabling 2 SATA port when adding a second NVME drive. To fix this I used a passive m.2 to pcie board [from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=pci%20to%20m2).

I have a RAID card, but it's not in use at the moment

- CPU: [i3-10100](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/199283/intel-core-i3-10100-processor-6m-cache-up-to-4-30-ghz.html)
- Motherboard: [MSI Z490-A PRO](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/Z490-A-PRO)
- RAM: 1x16Go
- Boot drive: 2x [Sandisk Extreme Pro 500Gb](https://shop.westerndigital.com/en-ap/products/internal-drives/sandisk-extreme-pro-m2-nvme-3d-ssd)
- Cooler: Evo 212
- Case: Nanoxia Deep Silence 3

What I looked after when building this machine was:

- A good iGPU for Plex transcoding
- A lot of SATA port
- Expandable in the future:
  - Z490 chips that is compatible with 11th gen CPU (and Xe iGPUs)
   - 2.5Gbps Ethernet
   - lots of PCIe ports

## Software

It runs [Proxmox](proxmox.md), mainly because its one of the few server distro that allow for root on [ZFS](zfs.md) in the installer. I might use some of the VM capability one day, but for the moment everything runs on [Docker](docs/celty/host/docker.md) straight from the host.

## Story

Let's start with the story of how I started sefhosting. This was on a Raspberry Pi 2B with a 2Tb usb drive, the only thing it did back then was download files that I could access via SSHFS. This was really terrible, this setup could only withstand a few downloads at a time and I had to pause all downloads to access the files.

Then came Celty. I got her for 50â‚¬ from a acquaintance. She was only a 4th gen i5 with 8Gb of RAM and a few hard drives. She was going to stay in my bedroom so I had to make her as silent as possible. This is why I got an Evo 212 and a Nanoxia Deep Silence 3. At that point I installed FreeNAS on her and started playing with jails, I selfhosted a bunch of stuff, and started de-googlizing my life.

When I moved to my first apartment is was in my TV closet, so the silent factor was still really important.

It's named after Celty Sturluson, a character from [Durarara!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durarara!!) who is black, mute, rides a noise-less bike and is literally headless.
