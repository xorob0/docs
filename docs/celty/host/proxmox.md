# Proxmox

## Story

Let's start with the story of how I started sefhosting. This was on a Raspberry Pi 2B with a 2Tb usb drive, the only thing it did back then was download files that I could access via SSHFS. This was really terrible, this setup could only withstand a few downloads at a time and I had to pause all downloads to access the files.

Then came Celty. I got her for 50€ from a acquaintance. She was only a 4th gen i5 with 8Gb of RAM and a few hard drives. She was going to stay in my bedroom so I had to make her as silent as possible. So I got an Evo 212 and a Nanoxia Deep Silence 3 and was able to sleep next to the computer easily. At that point I installed FreeNAS on her and started playing with jails, I selfhosted a bunch of stuff, and started de-googlizing my life.

## Current config

When I started working I gave Celty some upgrades and she became what she is today:

- CPU: [i3-10100](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/199283/intel-core-i3-10100-processor-6m-cache-up-to-4-30-ghz.html)
- Motherboard: [MSI Z490-A PRO](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/Z490-A-PRO)
- RAM: 1x16Go
- Boot drive: 2 [Sandisk Extreme Pro 500Gb](https://shop.westerndigital.com/en-ap/products/internal-drives/sandisk-extreme-pro-m2-nvme-3d-ssd)
- Cooler: Evo 212
- Case: Nanoxia Deep Silence 3

So why did I go with this setup ? I wanted to be able to transcode 4k so I don't have to keep 2 versions of every movies, and I wanted this upgrade to be my engame for a long time and at the same time, to still be upgradable if I need to, hence the single stick of ram and the Z490 chipset (that will be compatible with 11th gen intel core and their Xe iGPUs). This motherboard also has 2.5Gb ethernet which may be important for the future.

# Hard Drives

I currently have 6 hard drives in this box:

- 2\*4To
- 2\*6To
- 1\*12To
- 1\*480Go SSD

I am now saturating my motherboard's SATA connectors, which is not a good thing.

# Software

## Story

The Software side of things had a lot more iterations than the hardware side.

Back on my Raspberry Pi I was on Open Media Vault and really didn't like it. Every update broke the system, but I didn't have a lot of experience back then so that may be my fault too 🤷.

On Celty I used FreeNAS for a long time. Back in the days it was basically the only way to have ZFS with good performances. I kept FreeNAS for a few years until the release of [OpenZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs) 2.0.0 which made it possible to move to Linux.

At that time I a friend was setting up his server with OMV and docker and the simply of docker really intrigued me. That's why on December 2020 I moved to Ubuntu 20.04 with docker and [OpenZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs). I loved it even if the [OpenZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs) setup was quite messy because it was not yet officially supported by Ubuntu.

A few weeks later I upgraded my hardware and kind of broke my install. I decided to go with [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) as it was supposed to have a really up to date [OpenZFS](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs) version. I discovered this was false and had to install the beta kernel to have it working.

On my latest setup I tried [TrueNAS SCALE](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/) which just lacks too much docker features for me at the moment and Ubuntu server which I dumped because it doesn't support root on ZFS right now.

## Current config

### Operating System

#### Setup

I did my first [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) install for the ZFS support, which happened to be not as good as I hoped. But right now I am still rocking [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) for it root on ZFS support and I really like it. I have a dual NVME boot drive in ZFS mirror and I can easily do snapshot of anything on my OS disk.

#### Tips

#### Edge Kernel

I had to install the [edge kernel](https://github.com/fabianishere/pve-edge-kernel) to get my ethernet card working:

```
cd /tmp
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/fabianishere/pve-edge-kernel/releases/latest | grep 'browser_' | cut -d\" -f4 | grep headers)
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/fabianishere/pve-edge-kernel/releases/latest | grep 'browser_' | cut -d\" -f4 | grep kernel | head -1)
apt install pve-edge-*.deb
```

#### PVE Test Repository

To have a recent enough version of ZFS on Linux I needed to install the [PVE Test Repository](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Package_Repositories#sysadmin_test_repo).

```
echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve buster pvetest" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
apt update
apt upgrade
```

### ZFS

With my latest disk upgrade I started managing 2 pools, a stripped pool with most of my disks (badly named `HDD1`) and an other stripped pool with the disks I don't want in my main pool (named `extra`).

As explained above, I don't want my main pool to ever gets bigger than 5 disks, this reduces the risk that one of my disk would fail and also let me keep one SATA port available at all time in case I need to replace a drive.

I only have a few datasets:

- `HDD1/Media`: with all my medias (and my download folder). This needs to be on the same dataset so I can hardlink my movies from my download folder to my Movies folder (and avoid duplicates)
- `HDD1/Documents`: with my NextCloud storage, including my pictures
- `HDD1/Backups`: with some old unorganized backups and some new Time Machine backups
- `HDD1/Public`: with data from linx, it's limited to 200Go

I also have a ZFS root (`rpool`) partition with a few datasets

- `rpool/configs`: all my configs folders that I mount on my docker containers
  - `rpool/configs/plex`: some of my container have their own datasets so it's easier to backup

### Migration

To migrate from an existing [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) to a new install, all I have to do is:

```
rsync -av /mnt/old/configs /configs
rsync -av /mnt/old/var/lib/docker /docker
```

### Docker installation

I install docker directly on the [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) host as I probably won't ever use LXC or KVM.

```
apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
apt update
apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
apt update
apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
```

For raspberry pi:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo bash get-docker.sh
```

#### Portainer Setup

As I do almost everything from portainer I just fire it up and do everything from the commandline.

```
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /configs/portainer:/data portainer/portainer-ce
```

If I ran the migration lines this part should not even be needed.
