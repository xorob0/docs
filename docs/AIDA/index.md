TODO: Picture of AIDA (home assistant)

AIDA is my Home Assistant box. It's again a simple Raspberry Pi, this time with 8Gb of RAM and no hard drive. I needed an onsite dedicated box for my home automation because I never want it to be down for any reason. Ever.

It's running Ubuntu Server and not Home Assistant OS. This is because I wanted more control over the device (to add exporters, install custom containers,...)

It's named after AIDA from Agent of Shield, a robot that read the Darkhold and became an overpowered evil AI trying to become human.
