TODO: Picture of Tinker (server)

Tinker is my remote backup server. It's a simple Raspberry Pi 4 with 4Gb or RAM strapped to a 4To WD blue in a seagate usb enclosure.

It runs ubuntu server with ZFS and docker.

I made a deal with a friend, I could put a server in her appartment for my backup if the server also serves as a google photo replacement for her.

It's named after the disney character whom my friend like and I needed a name ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯. I often use `tinker` because it's shorter.
